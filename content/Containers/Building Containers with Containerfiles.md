title: Building Containers with Containerfiles
draft: false
summary: Using Dockerfiles (Containerfiles) with Podman to build custom images.
---

## Building basic images with Podman 

- A container's OCI image is a set of immutable layers stacked together with a copy-on-write logic. 
- When an image is built, all the layers are created in a precise order and then pushed to the container registry.
- Layers are stored as as tar-based archives and image metadata.
- These manifests are necessary to correctly reassemble the image layers (the image manifest and the image index) and to pass runtime configurations to the container engine (the image configuration).

## Containerfiles and Dockerfiles

- Container images can be built in different ways.
- Most common approach is based on Dockerfiles.

**Dockerfile**
- Main configuration file for Docker builds.
- Plain list of actions to be executed in the build process.
- A standard in OCI image builds and are adopted in many use cases.

**Containerfiles** 
- Name-change of Dockerfiles to move away from the Docker name.
- Same syntax as Dockerfiles and are supported natively by Podman. 
- A set of build instructions that the build tool executes sequentially. 
- The cached layers have the advantage of being reusable on further builds when no changes are requested on a specific layer. 
- Intermediate containers will produce read-only layers merged by the overlay graph driver.
- Users don't need to manually manage the cached layers.
- The engine automatically implements the necessary actions by creating the temporary containers, executing the actions defined by the Dockerfile instructions, and then committing. 
- By repeating the same logic for all the necessary instructions, Podman creates a new image with additional layers on top of the ones of the base image.
- You can squash the image layers into a single one to avoid a negative impact on the overlay's performance. 
- Not all instructions change the filesystem.
	- Only the ones that do will create a new image layer. (`RUN`, `COPY`, and `ADD`)
- All the other instructions, such as `CMD`, produce an empty layer with metadata only and no changes in the overlay filesystem.
	- These just create temporary intermediate images and do not impact the final image filesystem.
- Try to keep the number of `RUN`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions limited.
- Having images cluttered with too many layers impacts the graph driver performance.
- Containerfile instructions are commands passed to the container engine or build tool.

## Containerfile Instructions:

`FROM`
- Defines the initial base image used to build the container image.
- New layers that hold the changes are cached in intermediate layers, represented by temporary images.
- First instruction of a build stage.
- Defines the base image used as the starting point of the build. 
- Automatically pulls image if it is not already on the host.
- `FROM <image>[:<tag>]` syntax.

`RUN`
- Executes some actions during the build.
- New layers that hold the changes are cached in intermediate layers, represented by temporary images.
- `RUN`: This instruction tells the engine to execute the commands passed as arguments inside a temporary container. This temporary container uses the filesystem of the image you\'re building. It follows the `RUN <command>` syntax. The invoked binary or script must exist in the base image or a previous layer.
- Frequent practice to concatenate commands into the same `RUN` instruction to avoid cluttering too many layers.

 `COPY` 
 - Copies files or directories from the build working directory to the image.
 - Copies files and folders from the build working directory to the build sandbox. 
 - Copied resources are persisted in the final image. 
 - `COPY <src>… <dest>` syntax
 - Lets us define the destination user and group instead of manually changing ownership later:  `--chown=<user>:<group>`  

`CMD`
- Defines the command to be executed when the container starts
- Default argument(s) passed to the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction. 
- Can be a full command or a set of plain arguments to be passed to a custom script or binary set as `ENTRYPOINT`. 
- `CMD ["command", "param1", "paramN"]` (the *exec* form)
- `CMD ["param1, "paramN"]` (the *parameter* form, used to pass arguments to a custom `ENTRYPOINT`)
- `CMD command param1 paramN` (the *shell* form)


`ADD`
- Copies files, folders, and remote URLs to the build destination target. 
- `ADD <src>… <dest>` syntax. 
- Supports the automatic extraction of tar files from a source directly into the target path.

`ENTRYPOINT`
- The executed command in the container. 
- Receives arguments from the command line (in the form of `podman run <image> <arguments>`) or from the `CMD` instruction.
 - An `ENTRYPOINT` image cannot be overridden from command-line arguments. 
- `ENTRYPOINT ["command", "param1", "paramN"]` (also known as the *exec* form)
- `ENTRYPOINT command param1 paramN` (the *shell* form)
- Default value for `ENTRYPOINT` is `bash -c`. 
	- Commands are passed as an argument to the `bash` process. For example, if a `ps aux` command is passed as an argument at runtime or in a `CMD` instruction, the container will execute `bash -c "ps aux"`.
 - A frequent practice is to replace the default `ENTRYPOINT` command with a custom *script* that behaves in the same way and offers more granular control of the runtime execution.

`LABEL`
- Apply custom labels to the image. 
- Labels are used as metadata at build time or runtime. 
- `LABEL <key1>=<value1> … <keyN>=<valueN>` syntax.

`EXPOSE`
- Sets metadata about listening ports exposed by the processes running in the container. 
- `EXPOSE <port>/<protocol>`
- These ports are not forwarded by default when running a container based on the image and require explicit user action.

`ENV`
- Configures environment variables that will be available to the next build commands and at runtime when the container is executed. 
- `ENV <key1>=<value1>… <keyN>=<valueN>`
- Environment variables can also be set inside a `RUN` instruction with a scope limited to the instruction itself.

`VOLUME`
- Set a volume that will be created at runtime during container execution. 
- The volume will be automatically mapped by Podman inside the default volume storage directory. 
- `VOLUME ["/path/to/dir"]`
- `VOLUME /path/to/dir`

`USER`
- Define the username and user group for the next `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions when you run the image. 
- The `GID` value is not mandatory.
- `USER <username>:[<groupname>]`
- `USER <UID>:[<GID>]`

`WORKDIR`
- Set the working directory during the build process. 
- Value is retained during container execution. 
- `WORKDIR /path/to/workdir`

`ONBUILD`
- Trigger command to be executed once an image build has been completed.
- In this way, the image can be used as a parent for a new build by calling it with the `FROM` instruction. 
- Purpose is to allow the execution of some final command on a child container image.
- `ONBUILD ADD . /opt/app`
- `ONBUILD RUN /opt/bin/custom-build /opt/app/src`

### `podman build`

- Root image builds are located under `/var/lib/containers/storage/`
- Runs Containerfile instructions sequentially and persists the intermediate layers until the final image is committed and tagged. 
- These layers remain available as cache so they are available if the image is rebuilt.
- Cached layers can be removed with `podman image prune`.
- Can build in rootful or rootless mode.

`--layers=false` 
- Squash the current build layers into a single layer.
- Rebuild the image without caching intermediate layers.
- Reducing the number of layers can keep the image minimal in terms of overlays. 
- The downside is that you will have to rebuild the whole image for every configuration change without taking advantage of cached layers.

## Example 

Create a container with workarounds to run httpd as a non-root user inside of the container. Also, redirect logs to the containers stdout and stderr. Have the container expose port 8080:  

Containerfile:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd took 51s 
❯ cat Containerfile 
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest

RUN set -euo pipefail; \
dnf upgrade -y; \
dnf install -y httpd; \
dnf clean all -y; \
rm -rf /var/cache/dnf/*

RUN set -euo pipefail; \
sed -i 's|Listen 80|Listen 8080|' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf; \
sed -i 's|ErrorLog "logs/error_log"|ErrorLog /dev/stderr|' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf; \
sed -i 's|CustomLog "logs/access_log" combined|CustomLog /dev/stdout combined|' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf; \
chown 1001 /var/run/httpd

VOLUME /var/www/html

COPY --chmod=755 entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

EXPOSE 8080

USER 1001

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

CMD ["httpd"]

```

HTML:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ echo "Hello Jupiter" > index.html
```

`entrypoint.sh`:  
- Test whether the container is executed as root.
- Check the first `CMD` argument -- if the argument is `httpd`, execute the `httpd -DFOREGROUND` command; otherwise, it lets you execute any other command (a shell, for example). 

```bash
#!/bin/sh 

set -euo pipefail

if [ $UID != 0 ];
then echo "Running as user $UID" 
fi

if [ "$1" = "httpd" ];
then echo "Starting custom httpd server" 
     exec $1 -DFOREGROUND
else
    echo "Starting container with custom arguments" 
    exec "$@" 
fi 

```

```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ podman build -t jupiterhttpd .
```

Inspect an image's history and the actions that have been applied to every layer:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ podman inspect jupiterhttpd
```

Run the built image:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ podman run -d -p 8080:8080 -v index.html:/var/www/html jupiterhttpd
```

Verify it is running:  
```bash
❯ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                          COMMAND     CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                   NAMES
d45e568b58b0  localhost/jupiterhttpd:latest  httpd       3 seconds ago  Up 3 seconds  0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp  romantic_lehmann
```

Now you can visit your web browser to see the served webpage:  
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020260607093343.png)

The newly built image will be available in the local host cache:  
```bash
❯ podman images
REPOSITORY                                   TAG           IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
localhost/jupiterhttpd                       latest        0f326f00e9ec  18 hours ago   247 MB
```

Check out the 5 layers created:  
```bash
❯ podman inspect jupiterhttpd --format '{{ .RootFS.Layers }}'
[sha256:e574af19ee33701200ab0a37463b4cb62a4e546f4122f8e63a0f7a385523cc28 sha256:d0a0a2d17dda1e7df0bdc720daa0b8e4f477ab2dbfa31a7d05091a0355bdec79 sha256:86cd418b161f7b2df84bce5e6449f743941396b6ffe2e708b79e60723d71b575 sha256:88a25ebfd30850b4a4b46b337aa63413fb9df114bd56767d49df8f3cd5b14c5e]

```

View the layers with `podman image tree`:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ podman image tree jupiterhttpd:latest 
Image ID: 0f326f00e9ec

```

Build the image with only the fedora layer, and the remaining layers squashed together:  
```bash
Documents/podman/httpd 
❯ podman build -t jupiterhttpdsquashed --layers=false .
